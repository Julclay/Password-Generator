# Password generator

## Description

This week challenge in my Bootcamp class was this password generator. It generates a password randomly according the different character type selected by the user. This project helped me to understand better the function in javascript. I had to use several functions in order to refract my code and for it to be more readable. I also train more with loops and if statement for the parameter to be set for the user.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project. Just click on the index.html file and enjoy!

## Usage

A pop up window is opening in your browser and asking you question about the characteristic of your futur password. Click the 'ok' button for 'yes' and click the 'cancel' button to answer 'no' to the question.

Once all the pop up windows answered click on the 'generate password' button for generating your new password.
